# Multivariate Sine-wave Forecasting using LSTMs
This is a running fun project to predict the waveform of multiple, generated sine-waves using LSTMs in PyTorch. loaddata.py creates the dataset, consisting of N dimensions where N is the number of sine waves, which differ in their frequency and amplitude. LSTMmodel.py defines the underlying neural network based on an LSTM- followed by a linear layer.
